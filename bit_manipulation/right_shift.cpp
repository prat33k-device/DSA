// what will be the value of -1 right shift 1

// Binary representation of -1 in a typical 32-bit signed integer format: 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111
// Right shift by 1: 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 (the sign bit is replicated)
// After the right shift, the value is still -1. The sign bit is preserved during the arithmetic right shift.
